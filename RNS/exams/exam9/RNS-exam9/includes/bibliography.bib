abstract={The PIV control is one of the most common methods of tuning in servo applications. It works with two control loops, for position and velocity. This control method needs a reference input signal and two feedback signals that can be measured using a tachometer and encoder or using only a measure but complemented with state estimation. The disturbance rejection is one of the more important characteristics of a controller. The PIV controller can have a good rejection rate, but by doing an active disturbance compensation, we can improve the benchmark of the controller. In this article, we estimate unknown disturbances from an augmented state-space model with a UFIR-filter estimator. We gave some simulation examples to show the robustness of the proposed method against the classical PIV controller.},
